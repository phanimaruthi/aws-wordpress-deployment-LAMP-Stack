# WordPress on AWS — EC2 + RDS + ALB (Project Bundle)

This folder contains the step-by-step documentation and placeholders for images/screenshots you collected while building the project.
Drop your screenshots into the `images/` folder (rename them to match the placeholders) and push to GitHub.

```
wordpress_aws_project/
├── docs/
│   ├── STEP_BY_STEP.md        # Detailed chronological steps we followed

├── images/                    # Place your screenshots here (placeholders included)
├── scripts/                   # Helpful scripts (copy/paste ready)
└── README.md                  # This file
```

## What to add
